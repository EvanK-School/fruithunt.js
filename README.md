# FruitHuntJS

FruitHuntJS was a game I made years ago, originally for my "Tech-ED" class. It was based
upon the JavaScript tutorial in Chris Strom's book _3D Game Programming for Kids_. At the
time, I had no idea how the internet worked. (I still don't, but I'm getting better). Now,
however, I'm actually pretty decent and working with the internet. Thus, I decided to
finally give this game the dedicated P2P website it deserves. This is the result.
